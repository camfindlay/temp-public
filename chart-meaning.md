# Unlocking the meaning in a chart 🔐📈

Charts are diagrams that make data visible. They use colour, size, position and shape to represent measurements, patterns and relationships that are hidden in the data.

There's more to charts than just the data displayed, though. Most charts feature titles, labels and captions. This information, sometimes called 'contextual information', helps you to understand what the chart is trying to tell you.  

This exercise walks you through how to make sense of this contextual information so when you see a chart, you can figure out what it says and whether to believe it.



### Why should I read this? 📖

By the end of this, you'll be able to read a chart and understand:

- What the chart is saying
- How it's measured (units)
- Things that might trip you up
- Where data comes from
- Whether you can trust the information




## ❤️ Anatomy of a Healthy Chart ❤️

Lots of people make charts. Not everyone makes good charts, so it's helpful to remember that not every chart is a trustworthy as another 📊🚫📈.

The first time you see a chart, pause for a moment. You're going to need to figure out two things:

1. What is this chart trying to tell me? 🤔
2.  Should I trust it? 🤔

When you're trying to figure this out, there are 5 places to investigate:

- [ ] Title 
- [ ] Subtitles and metadata (like how it's measured and units)
- [ ] Where the data came from (data sources)
- [ ] Axis labels
- [ ] Legend (or other forms of labelling to help you distinguish different data types)


### Example 📝

Let's work through an example chart to see how this works:

Here's a [line chart](https://figure.nz/chart/1XbL3mcDqXvPtI0r) from Figure.NZ.

![Average export log prices by grade in New Zealand](http://i.imgur.com/Os3UJMf.png)



#### 1. Identify the different areas

First up, let's relabel all the words on the chart to see what each bit is. Our title, subtitle/metadata, and source are clustered top-left. Our legend is top-right, and our axis labels are along each axis.

The first thing you notice is that all 5 elements are present. That's a good first sign about chart trustworthiness—if any of these are missing, it's a warning sign 🙅🏻.



#### 2. Break down what each area is trying to tell you

Now that you know all our items are present, let's take a look at what each of them tells us about the chart, and how that relates to meaning and trust.



![Chart questions](http://imgur.com/HD3t3zQ.png)

##### Chart Title

The **chart title** tells us what the chart is about. 

On Figure.NZ charts, it explicity states both the what is being shown (average export log prices in New Zealand) and how it's broken down (by grade).

The title gives you your first list of things you'll need to understand about this chart. For this one, you need to know:

- What an average is.
- What a 'log' is defined as.
- What 'export' is.
- How 'price' is defined and measured.
- What 'grade' is for logs.

Breaking down the title into components helps to ensure you really understand the meaning of what's being communicated. Any industry-specific terms (like grade and log price) should be clearly explained in accompanying text. On Figure.NZ, you can find this in the "About this chart" section, but it can also be in footnotes or elsewhere on a page. If these explanations are missing, it's a red flag 🚩.

It's OK to realise you don't fully get some of the general terms like 'export' and 'average' (lots of people don't!), but it is important to go and look them up so you can understand the chart.

##### Subtitle

The **sub-title** gives you more information (context) on the chart topic. Most often, it tells you the time period and how the information is measured and calculated.

For our example, it tells us that the:

- Time period is 2006-2015 (also shown on x-axis label)
- Chart shows rolling averages, instead of just a simple count or average.
- Values are in NZ dollars per cubic metre free on board.


Like with the title, find the terms you need to understand:

- Rolling averages
- NZ dollars per cubic metre free on board.

It's important to look up these types of terms especially, because they can entirely change the way you understand the data.

In this case:

- a [rolling average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) is a way of calculating an average that smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends. 

- Log prices can be given/quoted at different points in a journey, like 'cost insurance freight' (landed at an importing port) and 'free on board' (loaded onto a ship at an export port). This impacts the price. The prices shown on this chart are for a cubic metre of logs 'free on board' in New Zealand dollars. 

  > Export margins charged by New Zealand's log buyers can range from 4% to 15% of a landed price at wharf. this was part of definition  but I don't 100% understand how it links, so tbc how we write this bit.

##### Data Source

The **data source** tells you where the data came from. This isn't necessarily who _collected_ the data, but who released the data. For example, Statistics NZ release data that other government agencies may have collected.

The data source is one of the most important indicators of trustworthiness. Some data is collected and published with an agenda in mind which can bias the results. A reliable, trustworthy source reduces this risk. In general, government sources are considered to be _more_ trustworthy.

In this case the data originates with the [Ministry for Primary Industries](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/), a government agency.

##### Legend Items

**Legend items** help you understand the different strands of data shown on a chart. Usually, they include a colour/texture swatch and a label so you can match the label to the line or bar or other aspect of the chart's visual display. Read by themselves, legends usually don't make a lot of sense—you need to read them with the chart title.

In the example chart, the legend has 4 items: Pruned, A Grade, K Grade, Pulp. Looking at the title, you can see the log prices are shown by grade. As such, you'd interpret each of these 4 items as grades of logs.

But, what do these mean? To really understand the chart, you need to know what each of these is. Like the title, a good chart will have technical terms like these defined in the supporting text/metadata. In this case, further explanation is available in the "About this data" section under the chart on Figure.NZ

##### Axis Labels

**Axis labels** give you points to measure the lines or bars against. They can be numbers, dates, times, dollar amounts, and more.

In the example chart, you've got 2 sets of axis labels. The y-axis (that's the vertical one on the left) has the price in NZ dollars. The x-axis (that's the horizontal one at the bottom) has the year and quarter the measurement was taken in. 

When you're looking at axis labels, check:

- Are the labels consistently spaced?
- Are there any missing labels or big jumps?
- Does the y-axis start at 0? 

The trend on a chart can be distorted if the scale (and therefore the axis labels) isn't set correctly. Missing labels or unevenly spaced labels are a good clue that you can't trust what the chart is telling you.

Likewise, be careful when the y-axis doesn't start at 0. Whilst there are some situations where this is appropriate, in many cases, this makes it appear like a proportionally small drop is actually much larger and much closer to 0 than it really is.

#### Test your understanding ✍🏾

Sometimes, it can help to test your understanding by summarising what you think the chart is saying in a sentence or two, using what you've learned from reading the surrounding information.

For example:

> Between 2006 to 2015, export prices for a cubic metre of A, K and pulp-grade logs in NZ (free on board) steadily trended upwards. The price for pruned grade, however, stayed more constant, with some smaller fluctuations, but was still higher than the other 3 types.

### Why are charts like this?

Chart designers often attempt to minimise the amount of text on a chart. They do this to avoid visual clutter and make it more impactful. The downside to this is that the chart may lack important information or rely heavily on technical terms, assuming the reader will know these. 

Sometimes designers get the balance wrong, but using the tools you've learned, you'll now be able to unlock the meaning in these charts 👍🏼📈
